Bill of Materials for a basic SportVFR board;

This may be somewhat dated on components, I first built this two years ago.

MCU - search for "Pro Micro atmega32u4"

IMU - Search for "10-dof IMU" consists of...
  MPU9250 - 3-Acc + 3-Gyro + 3-Mag  NOTE: Code uses HMC5883. MPU9250 is newer, I would substitute.
  BMP180  - Altimeter
  
Air Pressure sensors (Airspeed / AoA)
  Search for "MPXV7002DP module"
  
Display - "I2C 1602 Character LCD Display"

Input - Rotary Encoder  
    Note: Consider using RE with embedded I2C output controller; using the primary MCU to catch rotary encoder interrupts was tricky "glitched a lot".
