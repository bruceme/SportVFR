Bill of Materials for a basic SportVFR board;  Most of these materials you can find with a quick search on the jungle store.

MCU - "Pro Micro atmega32u4"

IMU - GY-652 "10-dof IMU" consists of...
  MPU9250 - 3-Acc + 3-Gyro + 3-Mag  NOTE: Code uses HMC5883. MPU9250 is newer, I would substitute.
  BMP180  - Altimeter
  
Air Pressure sensors (Airspeed / AoA)
    ABPMRRV060MG2A3 - https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Honeywell/ABPMRRV060MG2A3?qs=OTrKUuiFdkZ2B8eiLukmLQ%3D%3D
  
  Alternatives (will require re-coding): 
	PX4 Airspeed Module (MS4525DO is the sensor)
	MPXV7002DP - This is differential analog

Engine Sensors
	Tach - This is a 2-pulse per rotation 12v signal coming from my Magnetos, it's voltage split to 0-5v
	
	Oil Temp, Oil Pressure, Fuel Pressure, Fuel Quantity - These are all resistivity sensors with a typical operating range of 0-5kohm.  You can use any sensors that work on your engine.  You will need to calibrate them in the code.
  
Display - HD44780 - I2C 1602 Character LCD Display

Input - Rotary Encoder (CYT1100), usually comes with a small knob

Alert LED - 10mm Red LED
